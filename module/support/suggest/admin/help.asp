<h3>Suggestions Help</h3>

<p>
Suggestions are the comments and feedback that visitors to your
site send you through the suggestion module.  This is e-mailed to
the site administrator (configured in the Application configuration)
and also recorded in the database.
</p>

<p>
Through the suggestion module admin, you can lookup previous suggestions
that visitors have sent to you.  After you are done with a suggestion,
you can delete it from the list to keep your list clean.  In this sense,
it is much like a web-mail interface.

<h3>Suggestions Help</h3>

<p>
From the list of suggestions, you can click on the <i>edit</i> link to
view or modify the comments that were sent to you.  The suggestion
module will also send an e-mail to the ASP Nuke administrator that
you have configured in the application settings (click the <B>Application</B>
link from the administrator menu.)
</p>

<p>
If you want to respond to a comment that was sent to you, you can simply
click on the <i>From Name</i> in the suggestion list.  This will open up
your default mail client and fill in the <i>Reply To</i> field with the
e-mail address the person entered when filling out the <i>suggestions
contact</i> form.
